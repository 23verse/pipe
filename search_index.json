Schematic illustration of 4 steps designed for therapeutic target prioritisation, taking as inputs pleiotropic loci. Step 1 is to identify core genes with genomic evidence (leveraging context-specific functional genomic datasets) and peripheral genes with network evidence (leveraging the knowledge of gene/protein interactions sourced from STRING). Step 2 is to identify informative genomic predictors (cGene and eGene) that are not less important than the baseline predictor, i.e.Â nearby gene predictor (nGene). Step 3 is to combine informative predictors, generating a genome-wide list of prioritised target genes (targets at the gene level), ranked by the PIPE score. Step 4 is to identify a manageable list of genes that are most likely to mediate the crosstalk between KEGG pathways (that is, targets at the pathway crosstalk level).

The map was constructed using the 2D supra-hexagonal map applied to a matrix (containing PIPE scores) of 124 pathway crosstalk target genes that were identified in either psychiatric disorders or inflammatory disorders. (A) Illustration of the supra-hexagonal map used to self-organise these 124 target genes. Top panel: the 2D map architecture consists of 37 hexagons that are indexed in circular outward (H1-H37). Bottom panel: the number of genes mapped onto each hexagon. (B) Prioritisation map showing gene prioritisation profiles for psychiatric disorders (top) and inflammatory disorders (bottom). (C) Target gene clusters. The prioritisation map divided into 4 clusters, each covering continuous hexagons separated in while border. 6.2 Table Notably, the column PSYCH refers to PIPE scores in psychiatric disorders, and INFLAM for PIPE scores in inflammatory disorders.
